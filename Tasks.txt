-Create "top right" icon
    -Center "L"
    -Place at top-right
        -use absolute positioning

*** Find correct selector to all labels after inputs but not in header to be bold. CSS line 43 is a correct attempt; The "Phone" selector works, but duplicating it is not working for "Email" and "Address".

-Match bkgd color of header

-Match Font

Should I make the whole project one form? I have it as two now do to the contact info up top being in the header. But if the form was being sent to a server, that seems as though it would be confusing. (Research best option)>>>>don't use multiple. It would be unnecessarily complicated. Use <label>&<input> wrapped in a <div> in header; and <div> wrapping a <form> in the main.

Make sure to make this repository public.

What should we put for the form attributes? (nothing right now. this is a "clone of mockup" project)

Change name of file and all associated
    Will build exact replica of mockup instead of changing it to a marriage questioniere


Research:
    <label> Research attributes and values
    <input type="radio"> attributes and values

Find out why <legend> doesn't have "borderline" around it
